# Team Collaboration Guide

## Repository Setup and Management

### Current Status
- ✅ Git repository initialized
- ✅ Initial commit made with Team Member 3's work
- ✅ .gitignore configured

### Next Steps for Team Collaboration

#### 1. Create Remote Repository
You need to create a remote repository on GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket:

**Option A: GitHub (Recommended)**
1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com)
2. Click "New repository"
3. Name it: `canteen-ordering-system`
4. Make it **Public** (for easier team access)
5. **Don't** initialize with README (we already have one)
6. Click "Create repository"

**Option B: GitLab**
1. Go to [GitLab](https://gitlab.com)
2. Click "New project"
3. Choose "Create blank project"
4. Name it: `canteen-ordering-system`
5. Make it **Public**
6. Click "Create project"

#### 2. Connect Local Repository to Remote

After creating the remote repository, run these commands:

```bash
# Add the remote repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/canteen-ordering-system.git

# Push your current work
git push -u origin master
```

#### 3. Team Member Setup Instructions

Share these instructions with your team members:

### For Each Team Member:

#### Initial Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/canteen-ordering-system.git

# Navigate to the project
cd canteen-ordering-system

# Install dependencies (when package.json is available)
npm install

# Create environment file
cp env.example .env
# Edit .env with your local settings
```

#### Working on Your Module

**Team Member 1 (Backend Core & Database):**
```bash
# Create your branch
git checkout -b feature/team1-backend-core

# Work on your files in src/database/, src/auth/, etc.
# Add your database schema, authentication, etc.

# Commit your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Team 1: Add database schema and authentication system"

# Push to remote
git push origin feature/team1-backend-core
```

**Team Member 2 (Inventory Management):**
```bash
# Create your branch
git checkout -b feature/team2-inventory-management

# Work on your files in src/inventory/, src/stock/, etc.
# Add your stock locking system, etc.

# Commit your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Team 2: Add inventory management and stock locking"

# Push to remote
git push origin feature/team2-inventory-management
```

**Team Member 3 (Order Management - YOU):**
```bash
# You're already set up! Just continue working:
git add .
git commit -m "Team 3: Add new feature description"
git push origin master
```

**Team Member 4 (Frontend Core):**
```bash
# Create your branch
git checkout -b feature/team4-frontend-core

# Work on your files in frontend/, src/components/, etc.
# Add your React/Vue components, etc.

# Commit your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Team 4: Add frontend core and menu system"

# Push to remote
git push origin feature/team4-frontend-core
```

**Team Member 5 (Frontend Order System):**
```bash
# Create your branch
git checkout -b feature/team5-frontend-orders

# Work on your files in frontend/orders/, etc.
# Add your order flow components, etc.

# Commit your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Team 5: Add order system and real-time features"

# Push to remote
git push origin feature/team5-frontend-orders
```

#### 4. Integration Workflow

**When ready to integrate:**

1. **Create Pull Requests (PRs):**
   - Each team member creates a PR from their feature branch to `master`
   - Use descriptive titles: "Team X: Add [feature description]"

2. **Code Review:**
   - Team members review each other's PRs
   - Provide feedback and suggestions
   - Approve when satisfied

3. **Merge Strategy:**
   - Merge PRs one by one
   - Resolve conflicts if any
   - Test integration points

#### 5. Project Structure for Integration

```
canteen-ordering-system/
├── src/
│   ├── database/          # Team 1: Database schema, migrations
│   ├── auth/              # Team 1: Authentication & authorization
│   ├── inventory/         # Team 2: Stock management
│   ├── orders/            # Team 3: Order management (YOU)
│   ├── notifications/     # Team 3: Notification system (YOU)
│   ├── middleware/        # Shared middleware
│   ├── utils/             # Shared utilities
│   └── routes/            # API routes
├── frontend/              # Team 4 & 5: React/Vue frontend
│   ├── src/
│   ├── public/
│   └── package.json
├── docs/                  # API documentation
├── tests/                 # Test files
├── package.json           # Main backend package.json
└── README.md
```

#### 6. Communication Channels

**Recommended tools:**
- **GitHub Issues**: For bug reports and feature requests
- **GitHub Discussions**: For team discussions
- **Slack/Discord**: For real-time communication
- **Google Docs**: For shared documentation

#### 7. API Integration Points

**Key integration points to coordinate:**

1. **Database Schema** (Team 1):
   - Share your schema design early
   - Coordinate table structures with other teams

2. **Authentication** (Team 1):
   - Provide JWT token format
   - Share middleware for protected routes

3. **Stock Management** (Team 2):
   - Coordinate with Team 3 on order cancellation
   - Define stock restoration API

4. **Order Management** (Team 3 - YOU):
   - Share order status flow
   - Coordinate payment integration hooks

5. **Frontend** (Teams 4 & 5):
   - Coordinate API endpoints
   - Share WebSocket events for real-time updates

#### 8. Testing Strategy

**Each team should:**
- Write unit tests for their modules
- Create integration tests for API endpoints
- Test with other team members' modules

#### 9. Deployment

**Development:**
- Each team can run their module independently
- Use environment variables for configuration

**Production:**
- Coordinate deployment strategy
- Set up CI/CD pipelines
- Configure production environment variables

### Quick Commands Reference

```bash
# Check status
git status

# See all branches
git branch -a

# Switch branches
git checkout branch-name

# Pull latest changes
git pull origin master

# See commit history
git log --oneline

# See what files changed
git diff

# Stash changes temporarily
git stash
git stash pop
```

### Troubleshooting

**If you get conflicts:**
```bash
# Pull latest changes
git pull origin master

# Resolve conflicts in your editor
# Then add and commit
git add .
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts"
```

**If you need to reset:**
```bash
# Reset to last commit
git reset --hard HEAD

# Reset to specific commit
git reset --hard commit-hash
```

## Next Steps

1. **Create the remote repository** (GitHub/GitLab)
2. **Share the repository URL** with your team
3. **Set up team communication** channels
4. **Start working on your modules** in separate branches
5. **Coordinate integration points** regularly

Remember: Communication is key! Regular sync-ups will help avoid integration issues later.
